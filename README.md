# About me
## Hihi! the name's Adams.
### As I mentioned in my bio, I am an aspiring developer and technical writer. Now that's not to say that I lack knowledge on either fields. However, it does mean that I have quite a lot to learn and I am very much open to do so. I would love to participate in other projects, collaborate and receive advice. In addition to all that, here are some more things about me;
- 🔭 I’m currently working on an internship project at Outreachy
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Backend programming and Technical writing
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with python programming and documentation
- 💬 Ask me about anything. I'd love to answer if I can
- 📫 How to reach me: you can text me on messenger. Link's in my bio
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... 😐
<!--- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
